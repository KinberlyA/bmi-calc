# bmi-calc
Hi, 
This is my first project on GitHub. I've made only a couple projects, but I was inspired to make a gitHub because I am really proud of this BMI calculator:
Every input effects the ouput. If your choose 'female' the image in the 'weight' page is a woman and vice-versa. Then, the result page will also show a woman or man in the state 'underweight','normal',
'overweight' or 'obese' depending on how you measure up to general BMI standards. The color of the button displaying your result also changes with each result. Some things I want to change over time is the images in the end. They are very low-quality images I found on Google. Also, the website is not very responsive; it was made with a full-screen desktop in mind
